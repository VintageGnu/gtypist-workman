B:                           Lesson 1: Introducing 'tn'

T:Every beginner needs to start at the beginning.  For us, these are the letters
 :'t' and 'n'.  Finger positions for typing are: first finger on the left hand
 :(L1) should rest on the letter 't', first finger on the right hand (R1) should
 :rest on the letter 'n'.  This will naturally allow you to rest your thumbs on
 :the spacebar.

B:                           Lesson 2: Introducing 'he'

T:Having learned letters 't' and 'n', we are now ready for 'h' and 'e'.  While
 :keeping your left first finger (L1) on 't', rest your left second finger (L2) on
 :the 'h'.  Keeping your right first finger (R1) on 'n', rest your right second
 :finger (R2) on 'e'.  Your thumbs should be comfortably matched up with the
 :spacebar.

B:                           Lesson 3: Introducing 'so'

T:Time to learn two more keys.  Now you will be using the keys 's' and 'o'.  Use
 :your left third finger (L3) to strike the 's' and your right third finger (R3)
 :to strike the 'o'.

B:                           Lesson 4: Introducing 'ai'

T:The last home keys to learn are 'a' and 'i'.  Use your left fourth finger (L4)
 :to strike the 'a' and your right fourth finger (R4) to strike the 'i'.

D:a a a a a a a a aa a aa a aa a aa a aa aaa aa a aa aaa a aa aaa aa a a a a aa i

 :to curve your fingers and place them lightly on the home keys, with your thumbs
 :resting on the spacebar.

B:                           Lesson 6: Home Keys Conditioning

T:Conditioning, as in any sport, helps you work up your muscles.  This drill will
 :reinforce what you have learned in the other Home Key drills before this.  Also,
 :you will want to remember that the position you are sitting in will have a great
 :effect on your hands, wrists, and back.  Sit erect, feet on the floor, with your
 :wrists lower than your curved fingers.

B:                           Lesson 7: Home Keys Continued

T:In this drill we practice more typing of capital letters.  Pay special attention
 :to which finger presses the shift key to get the capital letter.  It will always
 :be the opposite hand of the hand you use to strike the letter.  Type one stroke
 :after the other without pausing between them.  Keep the cursor moving at a
 :steady, even pace.  Doing so will improve your typing rhythm and WPM, along with
 :the accuracy.

B:                           Lesson 8: Introducing 'lr'

T:Locate the letters 'l' and 'r' on the keyboard.  You will be reaching for the
 :'l' with your right first finger (R1) without moving the others from their home
 :keys.  For the 'r', you will be reaching with your left second finger (L2),
 :again without lifting your other fingers from the home keys.

T:Find the new keys on the keyboard below.  Use your right second finger (R2) to
 :stike the 'u', and your left first finger (L1) to strike the 'c'. For the 'p',
 :you will need to use your right third finger (R3).  For the 'd', you will need
 :to use your left third finger (L3).  Try to move just the fingers needed to
 :strike the key and not the whole hand.

B:                           Lesson 24: Final Letters Drill

T:Time to roll through some sentences.  Let's concentrate on picking up speed.
 :Read ahead a few letters and let it flow out of your fingers.  Relax any muscles
 :that you don't need for typing.

D:When we get really rocking on typing words, it really seems to make a lot of
 :sense.  But when you are first starting out, everything is jumbled.  Do you know
 :where you are to place your fingers?  Where do you look: at the keyboard or the
 :computer screen? Well, if you have gotten this far with mastering all the
 :drills, you will have noticed that the drills do not always make sense; the
 :drill notes do make sense.  Which would you prefer?  Helpful hints or sensible
 :sentences?  Jay and I think that the hints are more important. Are you feeling
 :pretty competent in your spelling as well?  If not, try out Master Spell.  It is
 :a blast. Making typing software and spelling software, we never have an excuse
 :for a typo nor a spelling error.  But it can still happen.

*:WM25
B:                           Lesson 25: Introducing '47 et al'

T:For the numbers '4' and '7' you will use the first finger on each hand (L1) and
 :(R1).  To reach the top row '4' you will move your arm slightly forward while
 :rolling your other fingers (L2) (L3) (L4), keeping them on their home keys so
 :you won't lose your orientation on the keyboard.  Do the mirror of this with
 :your right hand to reach the '7'.  Then to reach the '$' hold down the right
 :shift key with your right pinky and type '4' and to type the '&' use your left
 :pinky on the left shift key and type the '7'.

 :$34.78 and no cents.  *87 is not the number #78 is. #44, #77 & #88 are very
 :famous numbers. Please, may I have the $34.78 that you owe me?  Everyone, come
 :and taste this wonder.  Only $74.33 a bottle. In America, the symbol '#' can
 :mean pound or indicate a number.  Can you spell the symbol '&'?  7 and 8 and 4
 :and 3.  & $ # * Do you ever get the feeling that the numbers don't always add
 :up?

B:                           Lesson 29: Introducing '156 et al'

T:Now we tackle three new number keys.  Reach with your left pinky (L4) to the
 :'1', (L1) to strike the '5' and (R1) to strike the '6'.

 :day.  The symbol for gold is not ^.  I mean it! The combination for the safe is
 :left 3 times to #14, right 5 times to #7, left again, 1 time to #68, & then turn
 :it back to 1 and it should open. At least 45% of the time.  *88 is a good #.
 :Again!  Nobody likes #13 as much as #65, do they? For every tick of the clock,
 :there are at least 147 tocks somewhere else.

 :three.

 :do I have to tell you? Mary and Tom had a fight that lasted until 7:36.  My
 :phone number is 555-516-3356, but please do not call after 6PM.  A fake bike
 :license # could be #7X8-44-55;11 or even #134-56-7M86-17P18.  NO! Please do not
 :use ^'s in this sentence.

B:                           Lesson 31: Introducing '2@ 9( 0)'

T:Reach for '2' using your third left finger (L3), (R3) to stike the '9' and (R4)
 :to strike the '0'.  Make sure you pay attention to the shapes of the letter o O
 :and the number 0. It can slow you down if you do not.

B:                           Lesson 32: Conditioning '2@ 9( 0)'

T:Last drill on numbers and symbols.  Set a goal for yourself that is 10 WPM above
 :what you scored before and work towards it.  Remember your (number) 0's, &
 :(letters) o's and O's!  Consistency and patience have their rewards.
